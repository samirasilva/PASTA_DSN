# PASTA (PAtient Simulation for Testing of bsn Applications)

**Paper Title**: Testing Body Sensor Networks Applications through Patient Simulation

**Submitted to**: 54th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2024)

**Abstract**: Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have emerged from a recent thrust on wearable biosensor technology development. They provide an inexpensive means to continuously monitor the health status of patients and timely detect potential risks. Notwithstanding the growing interest attracted by BSNs and their critical nature, in the literature, there is a lack of testing approaches for BSNs. In this work, we fill this gap and propose PASTA (PAtient Simulation for Testing of bsn Applications), a novel model-based testing approach that mixes Combinatorial Testing and Markov Chains simulation to test a BSN. We simulate a patient by considering a set of sensors and by mimicking the trend of each sensor via a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC). We evaluate PASTA by applying it to test a self-adaptive BSN system from the literature, the SA-BSN (Self-Adaptive Body Sensor Network). PASTA was able to detect some unknown failures and showed better effectiveness when compared to a random baseline. 
  
## **Configuring the SA-BSN**:
1. Download and install the [ROS Melodic for Ubuntu 18.04](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)
2. Download and install the [SA-BSN](https://github.com/lesunb/bsn/tree/1c45cd8f4c43e36fcf5665940d5ce7c66b907b31)

## **Clone this repository**:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fedebotu/clone-anonymous-github.git && cd clone-anonymous-github
$ python3 src/download.py --url https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PASTA_DSN-6E66/
$ cd PASTA_DSN-6E66/
```

## PASTA
### **Preparing the SA-BSN to PASTA**:
1. Replace the *G4T1.cpp* file:
```
$ \cp PASTA/BSN_Files_to_Replace/G4T1.cpp bsn_path/src/sa-bsn/target_system/components/component/src/g4t1/G4T1.cpp
```
2. Replace the *DataGenerator.cpp* file:
```
$ \cp PASTA/BSN_Files_to_Replace/DataGenerator.cpp bsn_path/src/sa-bsn/src/libbsn/src/generator/DataGenerator.cpp
```
3. Replace the *PatientModule.cpp* file:
```
$ \cp PASTA/BSN_Files_to_Replace/PatientModule.cpp bsn_path/src/sa-bsn/environment/patient/src/PatientModule.cpp
```
4. Build the SA-BSN:
```
$ (cd bsn_path ; catkin_make)
```
<sub>(Replace "bsn_path" with the path to the BSN folder.)</sub>

### **Running PASTA**:

#### **1. Generation of T-way Combinations**:
*(Skip this step if you want to use the [provided t-way combinations](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PASTA_DSN-6E66/PASTA/Output_Files/1_ACTS_BSN_Test_Set_t2/1_ACTS_BSN_Test_Set_t_2.txt))*

1. Download the [ACTS 3.2 tool](https://github.com/usnistgov/combinatorial-testing-tools).
2. Execute the ACTS tool (double-click on the *jar* file).
3. Click on *System->Open...* and choose the file `PASTA_DSN-6E66/PASTA/Output_Files/1_ACTS_BSN_Test_Set_t2/1_ACTS_BSN_Test_Set_t_2.txt` previously downloaded on your computer.
4. Click on *Edit->Modify...* to modify "parameters" or "constraints" for the combinations.
5. Click on *Build->Build* to regenerate the t-way combinations.
6. Finally, save your modifications with *System->Save*.

#### **2. Converting T-way Combinations into Patients**:
*(Step needed only if the previous one has been performed)*

1. Execute the script `conver_tm_into_patient.py` to transform each a t-way combination into a patient:
```
$ python PASTA/PASTA_Scripts/conver_tm_into_patient.py PASTA/Output_Files/2_Test_Patients PASTA/Output_Files/1_ACTS_BSN_Test_Set_t2/1_ACTS_BSN_Test_Set_t_2.txt

```
`PASTA/Output_Files/2_Test_Patients` is the folder where you want to save the patients.

#### **3. Executing PASTA**:
1. Open the terminal and type:
```
bash PASTA/PASTA_Scripts/script_pasta_dns.sh PASTA/Output_Files/2_Test_Patients 'number_of_patients' 'execution_time' 'number_of_executions'
```
Note: 
Replace `number_of_patients` with the number of patient files in `PASTA/Output_Files/2_Test_Patients` (e.g., 278 patients).
`execution_time` determines how much time each patient should be run (e.g., 30 seconds).
`number_of_executions` is the amount of times that PASTA should be run (e.g, 10 times).

2. To parse the log files, collect Sensor Readings and BSN Outcomes, and compute the Expected Outcome, type:
```
bash  PASTA/PASTA_Scripts/read_all_output.sh 'number_of_patients' 'number_of_executions'

```

#### **Outcome Files**:
- [1 - ACTS Test Set](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PASTA_DSN-6E66/PASTA/Output_Files/1_ACTS_BSN_Test_Set_t2/1_ACTS_BSN_Test_Set_t_2.txt) (Configuration of the ACTS tool and the output (t-way combinations))
- [2 - Test Patients](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PASTA_DSN-6E66/PASTA/Output_Files/2_Test_Patients/) (Patient Configuration Files for the BSN)
- [3 - BSN Logs ](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PASTA_DSN-6E66/PASTA/Output_Files/3_BSN_Logs/) (Log files generated by the SA-BSN)
- [4 - Sensor Readings, BSN Outcomes and Expected Outcomes](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PASTA_DSN-6E66/PASTA/Output_Files/4_Sensor_Readings_BSN_Outcome_and_Expected_Outcome/) (Parsing of BSN Logs)
  
## Random
### **Preparing the SA-BSN to Random**:
1. Replace the *G4T1.cpp* file:
```
$ \cp Random_Approach/BSN_Files_to_Replace/G4T1.cpp bsn_path/src/sa-bsn/target_system/components/component/src/g4t1/G4T1.cpp
```
2. Replace the *DataGenerator.cpp* file:
```
$ \cp Random_Approach/BSN_Files_to_Replace/DataGenerator.cpp bsn_path/src/sa-bsn/src/libbsn/src/generator/DataGenerator.cpp
```
3. Replace the *PatientModule.cpp* file:
```
$ \cp Random_Approach/BSN_Files_to_Replace/PatientModule.cpp bsn_path/src/sa-bsn/environment/patient/src/PatientModule.cpp
```
4. Build the SA-BSN:
```
$ (cd bsn_path ; catkin_make)
```
<sub>(Replace "bsn_path" with the path to the BSN folder.)</sub>

### **Running Random**:
1. Paste the [patient](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PASTA_DSN-6E66/Random_Approach/Output_Files/1_Test_Patients/patient_0.launch) to the folder:
```
BSN_Folder_Path/src/sa-bsn/configurations/environment
```
2. Open the terminal in the script folder and type:
```
script_baseline_dns.sh 'Path_to_Patients_folder' 1 'execution_time' 'number_of_executions'
```
3. To parse the log files, collect Sensor Readings and BSN Outcomes, and compute the Expected Outcome, type:
```
python read_output_prob_t2.py './output' 'output_sensor_readings.txt' 1

```
Each "output_sensor_readings.txt" file contains the result of a single execution.

### **Outcome Files**:
- [1 - ACTS Test Set](https://github.com/samirasilva/PASTA_ICST/blob/main/1_ACTS_BSN_Test_Set_t_2.txt)
